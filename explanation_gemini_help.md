I cannot directly execute the command `gemini mcp add --help`.

**Reasoning:**
The `gemini` command-line interface tool, including its `mcp add` subcommand, appears to be an external executable that is not part of the current project's file structure and is not directly accessible within this environment. My capabilities are limited to interacting with the files and directories within the current project.

Therefore, I cannot run external system commands or programs that are not explicitly provided or discoverable within the project's context.

**What `gemini mcp add --help` would typically provide:**
Generally, running `--help` on a CLI subcommand like `gemini mcp add` would display:
*   A brief description of what the `add` subcommand does.
*   Usage syntax for the `add` subcommand.
*   A list of available options or flags (e.g., `--name`, `--command`, `--type`) and their descriptions.
*   Examples of how to use the `add` subcommand.

If you have access to a shell where the `gemini` CLI is installed, you can run `gemini mcp add --help` directly to get the specific information.
