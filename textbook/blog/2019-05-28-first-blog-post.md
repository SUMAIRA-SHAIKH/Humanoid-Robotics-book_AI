# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This course teaches how to bring AI into the physical world — connecting AI "brains" to robots' bodies.  
You will learn simulation, robot middleware (ROS 2), perception, and how to make robots act from natural language commands.

## Goals
- Understand embodied intelligence and Physical AI.
- Learn tools: ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac.
- Build a simulated humanoid that follows voice commands.

## Weekly plan (short)
- Weeks 1–2: Foundations
- Weeks 3–5: ROS 2
- Weeks 6–7: Gazebo simulation
- Weeks 8–10: NVIDIA Isaac
- Weeks 11–12: Humanoid development
- Week 13: Conversational robotics & capstone
