# The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

ROS 2 is the middleware that connects sensors, controllers, and planners in a robot.

## Core Concepts

- **Nodes**: Individual processes that perform computation
- **Topics**: Streams of messages sent between nodes
- **Services**: Synchronous request/response communication
- **Actions**: Asynchronous goal-oriented communication with feedback

## Why ROS 2?

ROS 2 addresses the limitations of ROS 1 by providing:

- Real-time capabilities
- Multi-robot systems support
- Security features
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, Windows, macOS)

## ROS 2 Architecture

ROS 2 uses the Data Distribution Service (DDS) as its communication layer, enabling:

- Distributed communication
- Language independence
- Quality of Service (QoS) policies
- Security and encryption

## Setting up ROS 2

We'll be using ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill, which provides long-term support for robotics applications.
