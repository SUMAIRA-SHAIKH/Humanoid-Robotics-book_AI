# The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

We use simulators to test robots safely.

## Gazebo vs Unity

Gazebo is physics-focused with accurate collision detection.
Unity is graphics-focused with realistic rendering.

## Why Simulation First?

- Safety: Test without physical risk
- Speed: Run experiments faster than real-time
- Iteration: Rapid prototyping of algorithms
- Reproducibility: Identical experiments

## Gazebo Features

- Physics simulation with ODE
- Sensor simulation (cameras, lidar, IMU)
- Robot models (URDF format)
- Plugins architecture

## Unity Features

- High-fidelity graphics
- VR/AR support
- Game engine physics
- Asset store resources
