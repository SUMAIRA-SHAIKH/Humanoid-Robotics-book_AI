# The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

We use simulators to test robots safely.

## Gazebo (physics)
- Simulates gravity, collisions, sensors (LiDAR, IMU, cameras).
- Use URDF/SDF for robot description.
- Practice: spawn a robot in Gazebo and run a simple controller.

## Unity (visualization)
- High-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction.
- Useful when you need realistic visuals or complex UIs.

## Sensors to practice
- Intel RealSense (RGB + depth)
- Simulated LiDAR
- IMU (for balance)
