# The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

ROS 2 is the middleware that connects sensors, controllers, and planners in a robot.

## Key concepts
- **Nodes** — programs that do work.
- **Topics** — publish/subscribe channels for streaming data (e.g., camera frames).
- **Services** — request/response RPC-like calls.
- **Actions** — long-running goals with feedback (e.g., move to location).
- **rclpy** — ROS 2 Python client library.

## Practical tasks
- Create a simple `talker` and `listener` node in Python.
- Write a launch file to run multiple nodes.
- Learn URDF to describe robot parts (joints, links, sensors).
